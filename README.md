VirtLabNet
==========

Main aim of the VirtLabNet project is to provide a virtual network environment to the users where they can easily change the topology by adding/removing/editing nodes like servers/routers/clients. This virtualized network may be deployed for training purposes as well as testing an application, software or just a network idea.
