VirtLabNet (Virtual Lab Network)
================================

Introduction
-------------------------------
Main aim of the VirtLabNet project is to provide a virtual network environment to the users where they can easily change the topology by adding/removing/editing nodes like servers/routers/clients. This virtualized network may be deployed for training purposes as well as testing an application, software or just a network idea.

<b>Background</b>

This project has been created as a successor of the KOVAN project [1].

Description of Work
-------------------------------

<h3>Research phase</h3>

* Virtualization technology should be decided:
  * Current virtualization technologies (KVM, VirtualBox, jails etc.) should be investigated.
* KOVAN project [1] should be analyzed.    

<h3>Backend Implementation</h3>

* Creating the infrastructure to manage
  * Virtual machines: routers, switches, clients, servers.
* Requirements: Bash, Perl, MySql, any other?, (may be revised.)

<h3>Frontend Implementation</h3>

* User friendly GUI for management
  * Created topology shown as a figure.
* User may change topology using the figure. That topology will be saved and may be realized (of course created topology should be checked if it is applicable.).
* Requirements: PHP, MySql, HTML, CSS 

<h3>Documentation & Dissemination</h3>

* Deployment Guide
* User Manual
* Dissemination activities (conference papers, presentations, social media etc.)

Skills to be Gained
-------------------------------
The following experience is expected to be gained at the end of the project. Having one or more of them already will make the project easier to iterate.

* Linux, BSD knowledge: Package/port management. Writing bash scripts, tools
* Network knowledge: Routing protocols, IPv4/IPv6 address management.
* Required programming languages and database experience.
* Virtualization technologies.
